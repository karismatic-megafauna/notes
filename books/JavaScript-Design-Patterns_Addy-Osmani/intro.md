# Introduction
Explains what a pattern is at a high level and gives a brief history of the GoF
and Christopher Alexander. Pretty cool trivia!

## What is a Pattern
Patterns are...
0.) Proven solutions
0.) easily reused
0.) expressive

And most importantly _not_ an exact solution!

Generally help prevent minor issues that cause major problems, provide generalized
solutions, decrease file-size, increase developer communication, become better over time.

## We use them everyday!
Apparently, jQuery uses the _Facade_ pattern a la `$el.css()` and `$el.animate()`

## Rule of Three
It is not easy to become a pattern, and generally to do this it must follow the
rule of three:
0.) Fitness of purpose
0.) Usefulness
0.) Applicability

Proto-Patterns are things that haven't clearly displayed (or displayed enough times)
that these three things have been satisfied.

Very simple chapter. Lots of good terms, may need to reference again.
