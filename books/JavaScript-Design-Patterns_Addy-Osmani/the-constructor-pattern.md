# [The Constructor Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#constructorpatternjavascript)

The constructor pattern, from what I can tell, is pretty simple. An object has
a constructor function that is called whenever a new instance of a function is
made. Because of this, some things about the new object happen. Properties are
assigned values, functions are called etc.

In Javascript, prototypes help us define methods on a new object and allow us
to use them once the object has been made

# Understanding
8/10. I think I get the constructor pattern, seems like it is pretty obvious.
Could use a less contrived example
