# [Writing Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#writingdesignpatterns)

For gaining appreciation for those who write patterns, we can understand better
how to use them more effectively.

Solutions in which neither interactions nor defined rules appear are not patterns

Look at other patterns, see what patterns _they_ overlap with.

Your pattern will overlap with other patterns, this is not bad.

Make sure your pattern helps the end user solve their problem, not change how
they solve there problem
